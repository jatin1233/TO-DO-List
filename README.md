# TO-DO-List
This is a mini-project I created while doing a course on Udemy about Web Development.
This project is purely based on Front-End of Website. I used HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT in this project.
You can add some To-Do's to the webpage by entering the task in the given textbox.
You can select a To-Do to have a line through to indicate that the task has been completed by simply just clicking on the task.
You can also delete the task by clicking on the Bin icon you get when you hover over the task you want to delete.
